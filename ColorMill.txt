This filter provides the ability to more precise adjust the red, green,
blue and balance intensity levels and saturation of a video clip. 

The following options are provided:

Red - This option determines how much red is to be scaled.
Green - This option determines how much green is to be scaled.
Blue - This option determines how much blue is to be scaled.

These three options are applicable on three states:
Dark - to adjust dark areas;
Middle - to adjust middle areas;
Light - to adjust light areas.

Also this filter provides the ability to adjust intensity levels and
saturation on the three separate states:
Dark - to adjust dark areas;
Middle - to adjust middle areas;
Light - to adjust light areas.

For example: to remove colored glares you can decrease saturation->Light.
